## vocab-notifier [ES/DE]
This little programme can support you to learn Spanish vocabulary<br>
A pop-up appears every few seconds with a random Spanish word.<br>

## How to use
1. Install `plyer` for python3: `pip3 install plyer`
2. Run: `python3 vocab.pyw`

## Configuration
Look into the source code to change the timer<br>
Feel free to add new words in `wordlist.json`<br>

## Other languages
F.e. to learn catal√† :grin: you can change<br>
`language1 = rnd_word['spanish']` into `language1 = rnd_word['catala']`<br>
and adjust the keys in the `wordlist.json` file accordingly.<br>

That's it, folks :-)
